# Unity-Voxel-Engine
An old, abandoned Project. I am not sure what I was headed with this one. I wanted to do a Voxel Engine + Turn Based.
This was a long while ago, cannot remember the reasons why I coded something the way they were but I beleive I took some inspiration from old Notch's code in some parts.

Could put voxels:

Also take voxels out:

Multiple objects were allowed at once:

In terms of rendering, it would be something similiar to Minecraft where faces that are facing something do not get rendered:
